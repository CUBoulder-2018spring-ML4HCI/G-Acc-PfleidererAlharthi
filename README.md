# Project Goal:
The way humans are able to use the technology we create heavily depends on how accessible it is to a given user. Since not all users share the same level of mobility, we wanted to create a product which requires only very simple gestures for manipulation. Specifically, we were drawn to the gaming sector of technology - and decided that there should be a way for individuals with impaired motor-skills to be able to play games using only their eyes as a manipulation input.
